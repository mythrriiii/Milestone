# Milestone

Every day, we set goals for ourselves, but staying motivated and seeing real progress can be tough. According to surveys, the number one reason people give up on their goals is a lack of motivation, often worsened by not seeing tangible results and good old procrastination.

That's where "Milestone" comes in. It's a simple app that helps you reach your goals step by step by journaling the process. Here's how it works: you snap a picture everyday to mark your progress and keep your streak alive. At the end of the month, the app puts together a time-lapse video, showing how far you've come. It's like a visual pat on the back to keep you going and make your journey more rewarding. So, you've got this! Let Milestone help you crush those goals, one step at a time.

## 📍The Problem
We noticed a common problem: People often set a bunch of goals but have a tough time actually accomplishing them. We've been there too. But why does this happen? To dig into the reasons, we decided to get creative with our thinking and put ourselves in the shoes of our target audience. 

Following the design thinking process was a game-changer for how we approached our work and helped us find our way to the solution.

### 💡Why do people not achieve their goals
The mental struggle you face when tackling a task is often harder than the task itself. It's this inner battle that often gets the best of us and keeps us from reaching our goals.

**Lack of Motivation:** The biggest hurdle is usually a lack of motivation. When you first set a goal, the initial week or so feels pretty manageable. But as you keep at it, things start to get tougher, and you might find yourself slipping off track. 

**Unquantifiable Results:**  The absence of quick, visible results can be discouraging. It's frustrating when you can't see immediate changes, and it can start to affect your decisions.

**Mental Struggle:** Your goals start feeling overwhelming, and self-doubt creeps in. You lose the one person who's got your back — yourself. You struggle with accountability and give in to procrastination. It's a struggle to turn your efforts into habits.

**Improper Planning:** The absence of structured plans and setting overly ambitious goals can be major turning points. When you don't have a clear roadmap for breaking down significant goals into manageable steps, it's easy to feel lost. You can't run unless you learn the walk first. Conversely, pushing yourself too hard can result in burnout.

All of these factors lead to you throwing in the towel on your goals.

### 📊Survey results
Did you know that a staggering 92 percent of people who set goals never actually achieve them? That's according to research by the University of Scranton.

[Research Results](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/science-says-92-percent-of-people-dont-achieve-goals-heres-how-the-other-8-perce.html)

Big, vague goals hardly ever get checked off the list. But when you set specific, challenging goals, you're on track to succeed about 90% of the time.

Take losing weight, for instance. If you're aiming to shed 20 pounds by the end of the year, that's a decent challenge, but it's not specific enough.

Try this instead: In August, I'm going to ditch refined sugar, bread, and fast food and commit to a brisk twenty-minute daily walk. That way, you're clear on your goal, and your odds of hitting it go way up.

Staying on top of your progress and having a feedback system are both extremely important.

But how do you keep goals specific and make it a part of your routine?

## 🛠️The Solution
Utilize Milestone to monitor your goals, establish a consistent routine, and see tangible results. 

### 🤖What is Milestone?
Milestone is an app designed to journal your journey towards achieving your goals. By pre-defining these goals, you set a commitment to upload a picture of you working on it every day. When you hit the 30-day mark, the app puts together a time-lapse video that shows you just how far you've come. It's like watching your progress unfold right before your eyes! 

If you've got a specific goal in mind, like learning a particular guitar song, you can upload a reference when you set the goal. The app will keep you in the loop about how close you are to nailing it, providing a handy numerical analysis of your progress. It's your trusty sidekick on the journey to success!


### 📝What is the process?
The app interface is pretty straightforward and super user-friendly. Let's break it down step by step:

**Create an account:** Start by downloading our app and creating your account.

**Create a goal:** Define your specific goal. Give it a brief description, categorize it, and decide on your start and end dates. While the default is a month, you can customize the timeframe. We also suggest adding mini milestones to break down big challenges into smaller ones.

**Specific your end goal:** If you have a specific end goal like drawing a fox, upload a reference. This helps the app calculate your progress as a percentage. Otherwise, your completion percentage is based on how close you are to the end date. It's a great way to measure your advancement mathematically.

**Take a picture on the app every day:** Take a daily picture using the app, capturing your progress on your goal, and upload it to maintain your daily streak.

**Share your process with friends:** Post your daily updates and check out how your friends are doing. Seeing their progress and taking small steps together will keep you motivated. It's like having a social media feed on your homepage.

**Have streaks with your friends:** Your friends become your accountability partners. Keep streaks with them to ensure you stay on track every day.

**Analyze your stats:** The app rewards you with achievements, and you can review your stats on your profile.

**Look back at your journal:** Look at little timelapse videos that have the memories of the process from your journal entries. They'll show you just how far you've come on your journey.

### 🧠Why does it work?
So how does Milestone answer these [Problems](#why-do-people-not-achieve-their-goals)?

**Continuous Motivation:** Staying dedicated to your goal is incredibly motivating. Consistently working on it turns it into a habit, and you'll steer clear of that sluggish feeling. 

**Quantifiable Results:** Your progress is crystal clear. The app calculates the percentage of your goal completion, which serves as a motivating yardstick to keep you on the right track. Plus, your time-lapse video can helps too.  

**Accountability Partner:** The app plays the role of your personal accountability partner, making sure you maintain those daily streaks. And you've got your friends right there through the app to cheer you on.

**Efficient Planning:** Going in circles won't cut it. You need a clear roadmap to reach your goal. When you hit those moments of uncertainty, check the milestones along the way to know exactly where you stand and stay on course.

You've got this, and your goals are well within reach!
